## Goal
Being attracted to the market sparked a curiosity during the pandemic. Although we knew that COVID had a negative impact on the stock market. The goal of this paper was to find whether or not COVID mortality rate had a significant impact on the market. The reason for this curiosity was to be better prepared for a possible case of another pandemic that involves high mortality rates.

## Process
Since this was a research paper, I had an Introduction, Literature Review, Empirical Mode, Data, Empirical Results, and a Conclusion and Policy Implications

Determing Varaibles that I would use as well as finding Data was the first task that had to be completed. The variables that I chose were unpemployment rate, interests rates, inflation & deflation rates, and real personal consumption expenditures. 

After picking my variables, I had to show the connection between COVID Mortality rate and the stock market. To represent the stock market, I chose the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Introduction contained this discovery and stated my thesis.

I then had to look for other literature review that may contain possible support for my paper. In addition with finding papers that supported, I also looked for papers that countered it. By looking for papers that countered it, I was able to dig deeper to search for possible errors that eld to an inaccurate results.

By creating an empirical model I was able to find the significance of each variable and their impact on the stock market. Running a regression gave a thorough run through of each of the varaibles.
